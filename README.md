# Greatest_Average_Within_X_Minutes
Description: Finds the greatest average of X numbers within the given data

This python file takes input from a text file in the form of integers, separated by line breaks and no other delimiters. The user specifies the file path,
as well as the range x, which is the range of numbers within which it calculates the average. The program iterates from index 0 of the input list to the length of the
input minus x, and calculates the average for each index i to index i + x, and returns the greatest number.
